\section{Abstract}

Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, particularly in low-resource settings like Bangladesh, where late-stage diagnosis is prevalent. This study proposes a machine learning-based Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system for early breast cancer detection using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic (WBCD) dataset. Supervised algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes) and deep learning models (Artificial Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network) were evaluated with and without Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Results show deep learning models outperformed traditional methods, achieving 98.83% accuracy (CNN) and 100% recall (ANN). The study highlights the potential of integrating FNA-based automated systems into clinical workflows to improve early diagnosis and survival rates.

\section{Introduction}
Breast cancer constitutes approximately 25\% of global cancer cases among women. Late-stage diagnosis significantly contributes to high mortality rates, particularly in developing countries such as Bangladesh. The traditional manual analysis of medical imaging is often time-consuming and susceptible to human error, highlighting the urgent need for automated diagnostic solutions.

Machine learning (ML) presents promising avenues for improving the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis. In this study, we aim to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Compare machine learning and deep learning algorithms for breast cancer classification.
    \item Evaluate the effect of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the performance of classification models.
    \item Propose a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to support early detection in resource-constrained environments.
\end{itemize}


\section{Related Work}

Prior studies have extensively explored the application of machine learning (ML) in breast cancer diagnosis. Key contributions include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Liu Lei (2018) achieved 96.5\% accuracy using Logistic Regression on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD).
    \item Zemouri et al. (2018) combined feature selection with deep learning techniques to enhance recurrence prediction.
    \item Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) demonstrated high accuracy in malignancy classification (Janghel et al., 2010; Hussain et al., 2011).
\end{itemize}

Despite significant advancements, challenges persist in optimizing deep learning models for small datasets and achieving seamless integration into clinical workflows.


\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Dataset}

The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) comprises 569 Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) samples, each described by 30 numerical features—representing the mean, standard error (SE), and worst values of 10 cytological characteristics. The dataset is imbalanced, with 357 benign samples (62\%) and 212 malignant samples (38\%).

\subsection{Preprocessing}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Categorical Conversion:} Label encoding was applied to convert the diagnosis labels, where malignant (M) was mapped to 1 and benign (B) to 0.
    
    \item \textbf{Feature Scaling:} Standardization was performed using the z-score formula:
    \[
    z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
    \]
    where \( x \) is the original value, \( \mu \) is the mean, and \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation.
    
    \item \textbf{PCA:} Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the 30 features to 8 principal components for use in traditional ML models.
    
    \item \textbf{Data Splitting:} The dataset was divided into training and testing sets using a 70:30 ratio.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Algorithms}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Traditional Machine Learning:} The following classifiers were implemented:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Random Forest (RF)
        \item Support Vector Machine (SVM)
        \item K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
        \item Logistic Regression
        \item Gaussian Naïve Bayes
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Deep Learning:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Artificial Neural Network (ANN):} Comprised of 3 fully connected dense layers using ReLU and Sigmoid activation functions.
        \item \textbf{Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):} The input was reshaped into a 3D format, and convolutional layers were used for feature extraction and classification.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Results}

\subsection{Performance Metrics}

Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). Table~\ref{tab:performance} summarizes the performance of each model.

KNN & 97.12\% & 97.50\% & 97.12\% & 97.06\% & 99.5\% \\
Logistic Regression & 96.54\% & 97.02\% & 96.54\% & 96.51\% & 99.8\% \\
ANN & 97.66\% & 93.65\% & 100\% & 96.72\% & 98.2\% \\
CNN & \textbf{98.83\%} & 98.44\% & 98.44\% & 98.44\% & 98.8\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Key Findings}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Deep Learning Superiority:} The CNN model achieved the highest accuracy (98.83\%), while the ANN model attained a perfect recall (100\%), indicating zero false negatives.
    
    \item \textbf{PCA Impact:} Performance declined for some traditional ML models like Random Forest and SVM after applying PCA, while Logistic Regression benefited with improved accuracy (97.68\%).
    
    \item \textbf{Clinical Relevance:} The high recall scores of ANN and CNN are particularly significant for clinical applications, as they reduce the risk of missed malignant cases—critical for early detection and treatment.
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}

The results are consistent with previous research (e.g., Xiao et al., 2018), which found deep learning models to be highly effective in automatic feature extraction for medical imaging tasks. In this study, the superior performance of CNN and ANN further reinforces the potential of deep learning in breast cancer classification.

However, limitations in dataset size underscore the need for larger and more diverse datasets to improve model generalizability across different populations and imaging conditions. 

Additionally, the mixed impact of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) indicates that the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction is highly dependent on the underlying algorithm. While Logistic Regression showed improved performance, other models such as Random Forest and SVM experienced slight declines, suggesting that algorithm-specific evaluation is crucial when applying PCA.
